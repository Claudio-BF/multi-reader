A simple program made to learn Rust.
It can read a txt file sentence by sentence and translate it into any language of your choosing.

In order to use run:
multi-reader -h

And then follow the instructions.

deps:
component
regex
rust-translate
tokio

I recommend "legally obtaining" a book in another langauge and converting it to a txt file using one of the many online tools available.
